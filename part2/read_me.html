   <h2>Documentation for Assignment 2, Part 2</h2>

   <h3>Notes: </h3>
   <ol>
      <li><p>The core styling of this application uses Bootstrap</p></li>
      <li><p>This application require a server that can run PHP and MySql</p></li>
      <li><p>This application requires Javascript turned on the browser.</p></li>
      <li><p>A small portion of this application was written using a Javascript library JQuery; used for some neat animation </p></li>
      <li>
         <p>
            I did not have enough time to include a content for another course. So far we only have one course in the database. But it's quite voluminous to allow me to test various
            aspects of the system.
         </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>All scripts used in populating the database are also included in the submitted zip folder, under e-learning_scripts directory.</p></li>
   </ol>

   <h3>Algorithm: </h3>
   <p> This web application was written primarily using HTML5, PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, and was ran locally using the XAMPP server for development.</p>
   <p>
      This application maintains 3 main SESSION objects; currentCourse (holds the id of the current course), currentUnit (holds the id of the current unit), currentLesson
      (holds the id of the current lesson). This allows for easy access of the user's request. We also implement a quiz for each unit. A user has just one try after which, the
      quiz submit button is disabled.
   </p>

   <h3>Structure: </h3>
   <p>Most pages in this application, were broken down into parts for easy manipulation, and code reuse.
      it contains a <b>core</b> folder, which keeps our DB scripts, some helper scripts, and out init scripts.
      it also contains an include folder which keeps some widgets used on the right menu of the screen, and the
      upper and lower portion of the page.
   </p>

   <h3>Markup:</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><p>TAGS used are: course, introduction, syllabus, unit, objective, lesson, review, titles, object, ref, research, summary, assignment, books.</p></li>
      <li><p>A course, has the following children: introduction, syllabus, unit, summary, research, assignment, books.</p></li>
      <li><p>A unit, contains the following tags: objective, lesson, review, quiz.</p></li>
      <li><p>A lesson, contains the following tags: title, object</p></li>
      <li><p>Learning objects could either be image or html-text</p></li>
   </ul>

   <h3>Parser:</h3>
   <P>
      We use PHP SimpleXML parser for parsing. Each lesson object in the lesson table is parsed from top to bottom, and its contains references to either the textobject table,
      or the imgobject table. Each image reference tag contains a reference attribute, a type, and size. Each text reference contains a type and a reference attribute.
   </P>

   <h3>Database: </h3>
   <h4>
      Our database contains 6 tables namely:
   </h4>
   <ul>
      <li>
         <p>
            courses: holds all information regarding a course. The fields include: courseID, courseTitle, introduction, syllabus, summary, research, books, assignment.
            The fields holds formatted html markup, that way each time we output a record to the browser, it gets automatically rendered.
         </p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>
            units: holds all information regarding a unit. The fields include: unitID, unitTitle, objective, review, lesson, quiz.
            The fields holds formatted html markup, that way each time we output a record to the browser, it gets automatically rendered. We don't use the markup in the lesson field for this app.
            it was used for debugging purposes. A unitID and it's courseID uniquely identifies a record.
         </p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>
            lessons: holds all information regarding a lesson within a unit. The fields include: lessonID, lessonTitle, lessonContent, courseID_Ref (FK from courses), unitID_Ref (FK from units)
            The fields holds formatted html markup, that way each time we output a record to the browser, it gets automatically rendered. The lessonContent field contains references of learning objects
            in a different table.
         </p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>
            quizzes: holds all information regarding a quiz for a specific unit. The fields include: quizID, quizContent, quizAnswer, courseID_Ref (FK from courses), unitID_Ref (FK from units.
            The quizContent field holds formatted html markup, that way each time we output a record to the browser, it gets automatically rendered. Multiple quiz questions related to a specific unit are stored in the table.
            NOTE: each record holds a quiz question.
         </p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>
            textobject & imgobject: are two different tables that holds all information for a specific lesson or lessons. In the textobject table, we store its contents in html mark up (p, div etc). In the imgobject
            table, we store the urls to different images that are stored in a folder structure.
         </p>
      </li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Comments</h3>
   <p>I'm glad I was able to pull off this part of the assignment. Now I have an understanding that I never had using PHP for web development. This method of using markups
      could be used for developing blog websites, and many more.
   </p>
