         <h3>Algorithm: </h3>
         <p> This web application was written primarily using HTML5, PHP, MySQL, and was ran locally using the XAMPP server for development.</p>

         <h3>Structure: </h3>
         <p>Most pages in this application, were broken down into parts for easy manipulation, and code reuse.
            it contains a <b>core</b> folder, which keeps our DB scripts, some helper scripts, and out init scripts.
            it also contains an include folder which keeps some widgets used on the right menu of the screen, and the
            upper and lower portion of the page.
         </p>
         <P>We have a partially functional user registration system, which stores all users that want to utilize our application.
            Only registered users are allowed to use this application. We block outside access using a protected page.
            This bookmarking application has the functionality to perform a full CRUD operation with bookmarks.
         </P>

         <h3>Database: </h3>
         <p>The database contain 2 tables. The <b>user</b> table contain all user details. The <b>bookmarks</b> table contains
            the relationship of every user details with their corresponding bookmarks name and url. A FOREIGN KEY constraints is
            placed on the bookmarks table to ensure Referential Integrity. The ID of a user from the users table and the name of a
            bookmark together form a primary key for the bookmark table.
